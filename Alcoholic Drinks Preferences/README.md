# Academic Research Visualization
Welcome to the repository for my Tableau visualization of the research I conducted during my B.A. in sociology, focusing on alcoholic beverages and gender. 

The primary objective of this research was to explore potential variations in preferences across different demographic factors, including gender, education level, age, family status, and geographic location. By utilizing Google Forms for data collection and Google Sheets and Excel for analysis, I obtained valuable insights.

To enhance the presentation and accessibility of the findings, I have transformed the original spreadsheet into a CSV file (the `alcohol` table) and created an interactive dashboard using Tableau. This visualization provides a comprehensive overview of the research results, allowing for a deeper understanding of the relationships between alcoholic beverage preferences and various demographic variables.

The `alcohol` table contains the following columns:

- id
- gender
- age_group
- family_status
- district - geographic location in Israel
- education_level
- favourite_drink

Feel free to explore the visualization and delve into the insights obtained from this research. Your feedback and comments are highly appreciated as I continue to grow as a data analyst.
